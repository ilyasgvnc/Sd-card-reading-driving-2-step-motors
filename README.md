# Sd-card-reading-driving-2-step-motors
This is microproccessors lecture mid term project

You can develop three motors for 3D printer or CNC rooter 

I use PIC 18F4550 and Proteus 
There is just simulation and CCS-C code blocks
 
You should read G-code from SD card and procces it.

There is different ways to make it,

G-code disciptions

You need to SD card image file to run code.
